# Power Consumption Prediction System

This project predicts power consumption across multiple zones based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. Using machine learning models, it helps identify trends and improve energy efficiency.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleans data and handles missing values.
  - Creates derived features such as `total_power_consumption` and `is_weekend`.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Time-series plots of power consumption trends.
  - Correlation heatmap of features.
  - Scatter plots to show relationships between variables.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- **Model Comparison**:
  - Evaluates models on metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
  - Highlights feature importance using Random Forest.
